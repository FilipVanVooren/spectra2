* NOTE - TODOS
* 11-03-2020    Rework tmgr "interrupt flag" code in "tmgr1a"
*               to make sure that user hook gets called now and then.
*               If the interrupt flag is always on because the timer slots
*               take too much time (e.g. write too many bytes to VDP), then
*               user hook code is never called because slots need to be 
*               executed again. If user hook code is never called then
*               keyboard is not read and program seems unresponsive.
* 
* 19-01-2020    Rework CPU memory fill and CPU memory copy for more speed
*                - 16 bit loop in scratchpad memory for copy and fill!
*                - Reduce loop penalty by moving multiple words (e.g. 4, 6 or 8)
*                  in a single loop.
*                - Add crash handler with error message for insane parameters
*                  e.g. tmp2=0
*               Add high-level file read/write library for text or binary files
* 14-03-2018    bit 10 CONFIG register reserved for alpha lock key down!
*               But code in VIRTKB buggy and disabled for now
* 25-03-2018    LDFNT routine is not using tmp3. Tighten registers useful?
* 17-11-2018    bit 2 CONFIG register contains PAL or NTSC detection. 
*               Remove PAL/NTSC check code and repurpose bit 2.
*               Everyone has F18a anyway.
*               Could use bit 2 instead of bit 12 and repurpose bit 12.
* 24-11-2018    Add "fctn-quit" mini check that can be used if both
*               virtual/real keyboard scan are skipped
* 09-01-2019    Add length check in all memory/vdp/grom copy and fill functions
*               Also there is some weird bug in xcpy if copying 1 byte!
*               During the second copy it crashes! Special handling
*               if length <= 2 bytes required/useful?
*******************************************************************************
* v2.0beta
*         2019      Multiple enhancements
*         Change    Removed equates to values in TI-99/4a OS ROMS again.
*         New       Added functioning dsrlnk + file I/O routines. 
*                   Added scratchpad paging functions
*         New       All equates moved to own equate files.
*         Bug-Fix   Removed hardwired registers in sound player prepare routine
*         New       Added length Assert in cpym2m and introduced 
*                   crash handler.
*         New       Added F18a reset function f18rst.
*         Bug-fix   Upon runlib initialisation the VDP color table and 
*                   font patterns were offloaded to hardwired addresses,
*                   independently of chosen video mode table.
*                   Now have 2 new equates: pctadr, fntadr.
*         New       Added trimnum function for turning unsigned number into 
*                   length-prefixed, left-justified string 
*         New       Added support for f18a 80 columns mode in YX2PX routine.
*         Bug-fix   Alpha-lock detection was inversed in real keyboard scan.
*         Change    Moved many functions to separate, skippable modules
*         New       More equates for hex values
*         New       New cursor handling functions at, down, up, setx, ...
*         New       CRC-16 Cyclic Redudancy Check for CPU memory
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* v1.2    2018      Major changes
*         Bug-fix   Virtual keyboard was missing keys for player 2. Resolved
*                   by adding "O" (p2 up), "," (p2 down), "K" (p2 left) and
*                   "L" (p2 right)
*         Change    Refactored GROM memory code into modules.
*                   Removed dependency of GROM module in LDFNT routine.
*                   Refactored library startup code to reduce code dependencies.
*         Bug-fix   Fixed bug in Speech Synthesizer detection (spconn)
*         Change    Reworked speech player routine (spplay). 
*                   Removed resident speech check. Only support speek external
*                   Removed parameter P1 in (spprep) routine.
*         New       Use constants embedded in OS ROM for reduced code size and
*                   faster (16 bit) memory access.
*         New       Introduced equates for skipping subroutines, allowing
*                   you to reduce code size.
*         Change    Repurpose bit 12 in CONFIG register from "keyboard mode" to
*                   "VDP9918 sprite collision" detected. 
*                   This is a crucial change.
*                   Bit 12 in CONFIG is set if C bit in VDP status register is
*                   on. The important thing is that bit 12 is latched even
*                   if C bit in VDP status register is reset (due to reading
*                   VDP status register). You need to clear bit 12 manually
*                   in your sprite collision routine. 
*         Change    Removed TI-99/4 check upon initialisation for saving
*                   on code size/GROM support..
*         New       Start breaking the monolith, use modules that can
*                   be included when needed only. Major refactoring
*         New       Added CLHOOK broutine
*         Bug-fix   Fixed low-level VDP routines because of wrong VDP bits set.
*         Change    Removed use of config bit 1 in MKHEX subroutine and
*                   got rid of multiple colors possibility. 
*         Change    Removed OS v2.2 check (config bit 10) and repurpose bit 5.
*                   Check if speech synthesizer present upon startup.
*         New       Check if F18A present upon startup (config bit 1)
*         Change    Repurpose bit 1 in CONFIG register from 
*                   "subroutine state flag 1" to "F18A present flag"
*         Change    Converted source from upper case to lower case 
*         New       F18A support routines (detect, 80 cols, ...)
*         Bug-fix   Removed 6 years-old bug!
*                   Overflow in calculation of X in YX2PNT routine
*                   resulted in wrong VDP target address.
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* v1.1    2011/05   This version was never officially released
*                   but contains many changes and some new functions.
*         Bug-fix   by TREV2005. Fixed YX2PYX register issue
*         Change    Introduced memory location @WCOLMN and rewrote YX2PNT
*                   for using MPY instruction.
*                   Adjusted format of video mode table to include number
*                   of columns per row.
*                   VIDTAB subroutine adjusted as well.
*         Change    Removed subroutine GTCLMN. The functionality is replaced
*                   by the @WCOLMN memory location.
*         New       Added subroutine SCRDIM for setting base and
*                   width of a virtual screen.
*         Change    Introduced memory locations WAUX1,WAUX2,WAUX3.
*         Change    PUTBOX completely rewritten, now supports repeating
*                   vertically and/or horizontally.
*                   This is how its supposed to work from day one..
*                   WARNING PUTBOX is not compatible with V1.
*                   width & height swapped in P1.
*         Change    Removed memory location WSEED.
*                   On startup value is in WAUX1.
*                   Added parameter P1 to RND subroutine (address random seed)
*         Change    Modified FILBOX subroutine. Width and height swapped
*                   in P1 so that it is the same as for PUTBOX subroutine.
*         New       Added VIEW subroutine. This is a viewport into
*                   a virtual screen.
*         New       Added RLE2V subroutine.
*                   Decompress RLE (Run Length Encoded data) to VRAM.
